  "content": "In countries where there is an outbreak, the majority of cases in humans have\r\noccurred as a result of human-to-human transmission. Infection occurs from\r\ndirect contact of body fluids (blood, mucus, stool, urine, saliva, sweat,\r\nsemen) of a person who is infected. Infection can also occur if broken skin of\r\na healthy person come into contact with environments that have become\r\ncontaminated with an Ebola patient's infectious fluids such as soiled\r\nclothing, bed linen, or used needles.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 health-care workers have been exposed to the virus while caring for Ebola patients. This happens because they may not have been wearing personal protection equipment or were not properly applying infection prevention and control measures when caring for the patients. Health-care providers at all levels of the health system \u2013 hospitals, clinics, and health posts \u2013 should be briefed on the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted, and strictly follow recommended infection control precautions.\r\n\r\nWHO does not advise families or communities to care for individuals who may present with symptoms of Ebola virus disease in their homes. Rather, seek treatment in a hospital or treatment centre staffed by doctors and nurses qualified and equipped to treat Ebola virus victims. If you do \r\nchoose to care for your loved one at home, WHO strongly advises you to notify your local public health authority and receive appropriate training, equipment (gloves and personal protective equipment [PPE]) for treatment, instructions on proper removal and disposal of PPE, and information on how to prevent further infection and transmission of the disease to yourself, other family members, or the community.",
